# auto-lightbox
An automatic lightbox that will show and hide when its parent element does, Now has a jQuery plugin (but does not require jQuery, can be used standalone).
It will try to guess at proper z-indexes for itself and multiple parent elements, but if it gets out of whack set explicit z-indexes on all your parent elements that it will be attached to.

# The jQuery way:

```
$(".mymodal").autolightbox();
```

If you want another child window to take ownership of the lightbox:

```
$(".childofmymodal").autolightbox();
```

Just make sure to pass ownership back to mymodal when childofmymodal is closed.

# The standalone way:

```
\\ you can pass in a dom element:
var lightbox = Autolightbox(myelement);

\\ give control to another element, you can also use a query selector:
lightbox.parent(".somethingelse");
```
